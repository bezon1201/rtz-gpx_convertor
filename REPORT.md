# Architect review handoff

## Status

- Gate 1: **APPROVED / PASS**.
- IP-1 plan: **APPROVED / READY FOR GATE 3 CROSS-CHECK**; IP-1 execution remains **NOT AUTHORIZED**.
- IP-2 plan: **SUBMITTED FOR ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW**; planning only.
- IP-2 execution and overall implementation: **NOT AUTHORIZED**. No implementation PASS is claimed.

## IP-2 planning deliverable

Created `docs/implementation/IP-2-SAFE-INPUT-MODEL-PARSER-PLAN.md` from approved IP-1 planning revision `6ed649d3995f70fa2421e08cb027c07d19b4cad4`. It defines secure single-file ingestion, strict exact-pair dispatch, separate XML/schema/semantic phases, immutable route model, diagnostics, synthetic test matrix, API boundaries, future IP-2A–IP-2E decomposition, acceptance criteria and handoffs.

Key recommendations: Foundation XMLParser is a candidate only; security/resource behavior needs authorized verification. Schema validation is an independent layer and requires a legally cleared offline strategy. No exact 1.2 namespace is guessed. Proposed numeric resource limits remain unapproved until workload/adversarial evidence and review. Fail closed for unqualified dialects, unavailable schemas, unsafe XML and fatal semantic errors. No partial model on fatal input.

The model preserves XML waypoint order independently of waypoint IDs, treats destination waypoint leg metadata as incoming, distinguishes optional absence from defaults, and never repairs coordinates or guesses geometry. RTZP remains out of scope. IP-3/IP-4/IP-5/IP-7 handoffs are described without implementing their work.

## Approved upstream direction

V1 remains an offline macOS Apple Silicon tool with a macOS Shortcut as primary UI and a self-contained local CLI, no standalone GUI, and no target-Mac Homebrew/Python requirement. It supports the three approved route modes with explicit user selections, emits GPX 1.1, preserves the input RTZ, and makes metadata losses visible. No automatic navigation decisions or ECDIS-equivalence claim. RTZ 1.0/1.2 are mandatory targets subject to qualification; 1.1 is conditional; RTZP is out of scope. Distance remains advisory only. IP-1 review conditions remain recorded in its approved plan.

## Open dependencies and risks

- IP-1A must qualify exact 1.0/1.2 schema pairs, hashes and fields and resolve legal/runtime validation strategy; these block parser implementation.
- IP-1B must supply reviewed synthetic fixture IDs and outcomes.
- IP-2A must verify parser behavior, resource enforcement, limits, cancellation and file-reference security on candidate macOS versions.
- ID uniqueness, minimum useful waypoint count, geometry literals, optional metadata rules, precision representation and extension-summary policy require evidence/review.
- IP-5/IP-7 must cross-check diagnostic identifiers and file-reference handoff before those contracts freeze.

No contradiction with the Master Plan or IP-1 was identified. Dependencies that remain conditional are explicitly marked; no schema version, licensing, runtime, or security behavior is represented as implemented or tested.

## Changed files and verification

- `docs/implementation/IP-2-SAFE-INPUT-MODEL-PARSER-PLAN.md`
- `REPORT.md`
- `PROGRESS.md`

Documentation-only changes. No application code, parser, model, fixture, test, schema, dependency, CLI, Shortcut, package, or test run. No real RTZ/GPX routes, derived coordinates, or credentials are included.

## Repository state

- Branch: `docs/ip-2-safe-input-model-parser`
- Base: approved IP-1 planning commit `6ed649d3995f70fa2421e08cb027c07d19b4cad4`
- Remote: `https://github.com/bezon1201/rtz-gpx_convertor.git`
- Commit SHA and remote verification are recorded in the task handoff after the focused planning commit.

## Review request and next process

Please review the IP-2 architecture, proposed limits, security behavior, semantic classifications, model semantics, and upstream blockers. After IP-2 review and separate authorization for the remaining detailed plans, cross-check the full plan set at Gate 3, resolve findings, then obtain explicit Gate 4 authorization before any implementation. Stop after this planning commit.
